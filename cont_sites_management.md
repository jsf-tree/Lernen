# Contaminated Sites management

### Sampling techniques
- Injection logging provides a profile of the hydraulic conductivity in the soil
- Slug test is a traditional method for estimating the hydraulic conductivity and consists of adding or taking a bit (slug) of water.
- Interface is the name given to a measuring tape that takes the water or oil head 

- Bark Biofilter is applied in CITEL, acolmatation and humidification – Colleague suggested book called "Pollution & Biofiltration"

- Pollutants like chlorinated organics sink fast until reaching the water head. 
From there on, part remains as LNAPL (light non-aqueous phase liquid). 

in outbreaks treat with thermal <- does not pay to do in large areas
in others less oxireduction
